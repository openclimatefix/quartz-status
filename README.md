## Getting Started
### Installing

We use yarn as our package manager.

```bash
yarn install
```

### Setting Environment Variables

The following environment variables need to be populated.
Create a file `.env` in the root of this app folder; this will be .gitignored, so you can add your own values but ensure you do not commit this file.

```bash
# .env
PORT=3000
```

> In Production, these will come from the hosting environment and be injected into the Node.js app.

### Running the App

Now we are ready to run the app. 

```bash
## Runs the app in development mode, watching for changes
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
